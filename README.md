### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My Story
Hello! I'm X and currently a student in @Holberton School PARIS ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.<br>
I'd be finishing my studies on this November and I'm looking for an internship in WebDev.<br>

During my first year at Holberton, I worked mainly in C language, Python and bash scripting.<br>
Thus Iâ€™m comfortable with web development in Python with focus on unit testing and building MySQL Databases.<br>

I recreated the printf function and Linux Shell with 2 different groups.<br> 
Thanks to the school learning approach we learned to work collaboratively, in person and remotely.<br>
